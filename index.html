            Build a file.
            Make a commit. ...

     <h1>   What are Git and GitHub?</h1>
Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds as open source software for tracking changes in a distributed version control system.

Git is open source because its source code is made freely available for anyone to modify and use, aside from its creator. Open-source projects are built and maintained collectively by different developers in different locations.

Git track changes via a distributed version control system. This means that Git can track the state of different versions of your projects while you're developing them. It is distributed because you can access your code files from another computer – and so can other developers.
