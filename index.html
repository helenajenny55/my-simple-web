            Create your GitHub account, which you should have already done, thanks to the previous section!
            Create a repository or “repo” for short. This is where you store your code.
            Build a file.
            Make a commit. ...
            Connect your repo with your computer system.</p>

     <h1>   What are Git and GitHub?</h1>
Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds as open source software for tracking changes in a distributed version control system.

Git is open source because its source code is made freely available for anyone to modify and use, aside from its creator. Open-source projects are built and maintained collectively by different developers in different locations.

Git track changes via a distributed version control system. This means that Git can track the state of different versions of your projects while you're developing them. It is distributed because you can access your code files from another computer – and so can other developers.

        <li>git add .</li>
        <li>git commit -m"meaningfulcommit message"</li>
        <li>git push</li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="m">let's say you have "workspace" folder and inside this folder you have "new" folder which contains the code you want to add to an existing repo. Now, you go inside "workspace" folder and git clone the existing repo there with the folder name "existing". Now, inside "workspace" folder you have two folders: "existing" which contains the code from the existing repo and "new" which contains the code you want to add to an existing repo. Now, copy the code from "new" folder to "existing" folder, go inside "existing" folder, and commit & push the changes to your remote serve</div>
